# 🔐 PasswordCrackerAssignment

This Java project demonstrates how passwords can be cracked using two common techniques: **dictionary attacks** and **brute-force attacks**. It is meant purely for **educational purposes** to raise awareness about password security. 🚫 **Do not use it for unethical or illegal activities.**

---

## ✨ Features

- 📖 **Dictionary Attack** – Attempts to crack a password using a list of commonly used passwords.
- 🧠 **Brute-Force Attack** – Tries every possible combination of characters up to a certain length.
- 💻 **Command-Line Interface** – Simple and easy to use from the terminal.
- 🎓 **Educational Purpose** – Understand the risks of weak passwords.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher installed.

### 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeromearsany/PasswordCrackerAssignment.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd PasswordCrackerAssignment
   ```

3. **Compile the Java program**

   ```bash
   javac PasswordCracker.java
   ```

4. **Run the program**

   ```bash
   java PasswordCracker
   ```

## 🧪 Usage

When you run the program, you'll be asked to choose between a **dictionary attack** or a **brute-force attack**.

- 📂 **Dictionary Attack**: Uses the `dictionary.txt` file (make sure it's in the project folder).
- 💥 **Brute-Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations of characters to find the password.

Make sure the `dictionary.txt` file is present in the project root directory, especially for the dictionary attack to work correctly.
